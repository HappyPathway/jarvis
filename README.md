## Uploading Files to OpenAI

### Purpose
Uploading files to OpenAI can be used to train machine learning models. The files may contain data that is necessary for the training process. This can help in creating more accurate and efficient models.

### Instructions
1. Ensure you have the `openai` library installed. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install openai
   ```
2. Save the file you want to upload in the same directory as the `upload_to_openai.py` script.
3. Run the `upload_to_openai.py` script with the file path as an argument:
   ```
   python upload_to_openai.py <file_path>
   ```
4. The script will upload the file to OpenAI and print the file ID if the upload is successful.
